## Day 4 - Linux User & Privilege Mangement

## 1. /etc/login.defs - Password Policy Configuration 
Controls password aging policies and user account default settings.

- PASS_MAX_DAYS: Maximum number of days a password is valid.
- PASS_MIN_DAYS: Minimum number of days allowed between password changes.
- PASS_MIN_LEN: Mininmum length of an acceptable password.
- PASS_WARN_AGE: Number of days warning given before password expiration.

## 2 'chage' - Mange Password Aging & Expiry
Used to view or modify password aging for user accounts.

### Common Flags: 
- '-l': List password aging info
- '-m': Minimum days between password changes 
- '-M': Maximum days password is valid
- '-W': Warning days before expiration
- '-I': Inactive days after expiration
- '-E': Account expiration date 

### EXAMPLE: 

chage -M 90 username         # Max age = 90 days 
chage -m 7 username          # Min age = 7 days
chage -W 10 username         # Warn 10 days before expiration
chage -I 5 username          # Inactive after 5 days
chage -E 2025-12-31 user     # Expire account on Dec 31, 2025

## 3. /etc/shadow - Secure User Password File 

- Stores hashed passwords and aging values.
- Use grep username /etc/shadow to review settings

## 4. su vs sudo

-su: switch user (usually to root). Requires root password.
-sudo: Run commands with elevated priveleges. Safer and more auditable.

## 5. visudo - safely edit/etc/sudoers

- Prevents syntax errors that could break root access.
- Use visudo instead of editing /etc/sudoers directly

## System Info Command 

- dmidecode: View detailed system hardware info (BIOS,CPU, etc). Requires root.

## Monitoring Users:

- who: See logged-in users
- w: See what users are doing
- last: View login history
Use last | more - for a one page output
- id username: see UID,GID and groups
- pinky: gives you light detailed user info

Messaging & Communications

- users: Show username of currently logged-in users
- write username: Send message to a specific user
- wall: Broadcast message to all users
