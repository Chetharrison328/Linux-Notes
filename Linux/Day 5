# Day 5 – Linux Directory Services, System Utilities & Processes

## 1. What I Learned

### Linux Directory Services & Authentication
- **Local Accounts**: Stored directly on the system.
- **Domain/Directory Accounts**: Authenticated using external services.

#List of Directories:
- **LDAP**: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol – open standard used across OSes.
- **Active Directory**: Microsoft’s centralized directory service.
- **WinBind**: Allows Linux to communicate with Active Directory via Samba.
- **OpenLDAP**: Open-source LDAP used for directory services in Linux environments.
- **Identity Management Examples**: JumpCloud, IBM Directory Server, Red Hat IDM.

### System Utility Commands
| Command     | Description                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `date`      | Displays current date and time               |
| `uptime`    | Shows how long the system has been running   |
| `hostname`  | Displays or sets the system hostname         |
| `uname`     | Displays system and kernel information       |
| `which`     | Shows path of executable in use              |
| `cal`       | Prints a calendar                            |
| `bc`        | Command-line calculator                      |

### Processes and Jobs (Introduction)
- **Process**: An executing program or script.
- **Daemon**: Background process that runs continuously (e.g., sshd).
- **Script**: A series of commands for automation.
- **Job**: A scheduled or background task.
- **Thread**: A lightweight process within a process.

### Important Commands (Deeper Dive Coming Later)
- `systemctl`: Manages services and processes (start, stop, restart).
- `ps`: Views currently running processes (snapshot).
- `top`: Live view of running processes and system resources.
- `kill`: Sends signal to processes to terminate or restart.
- `crontab`: Manages scheduled recurring tasks.
- `at`: Schedules one-time tasks.

## 2. Questions I Had
- In what situations would a company choose OpenLDAP over Active Directory?
- Is there an advantage to using JumpCloud over more traditional directory services?

---

## 3. How Things Connected
- This tied into everything I’ve learned about user accounts (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`, etc.).
- Utility tools like `uptime`, `date`, and `hostname` are essential for real-world ticket troubleshooting.
- Managing processes connects directly with scripting and automation.

---

## 4. What I Needed to Try Next
- Run and test `systemctl`, `ps`, `top`, and `kill` commands on my Homelab.
- Practice setting up a `crontab` and `at` job.
- Use utility commands (`which`, `uname`, `uptime`, `date`) to simulate troubleshooting steps.

---

## 5. Real-World Application / Use Case
- Helpdesk or Linux admin roles would expect me to:
  - Integrate servers into an AD or LDAP system.
  - Monitor and restart services using `systemctl`.
  - Schedule regular tasks using `crontab` (like log cleanup or backups).
  - Identify and stop frozen or problematic processes with `top` and `kill`.
  - Use tools like `uptime`, `date`, and `hostname` for quick system diagnostics.
