# Day 3 - sed command & user management

## Summary 

Today I learned how to use the 'sed' command & saw how the command can manipulate texts in files. 
I also learned how to manage user & group accounts in Linux using built-in commands.
Today, I saw that these core system administration skills are useful. Plus, they're useful for log management, config edits, and user access control.

## sed Commands

1. sed 's/name//g' filename
What it does: Removes every instance of the word "name" from a file but does not modify the file permanently.

sed -i 's/name//g' filename -> adding the "-i" to the command will modify the file permanently.

2. sed '/name/d' filename
What it does: Deletes any line that contains "name" 

3. sed '/^$/d' filename 
What it does: Deletes empty lines from a file.

## User & Group Management Commands (You can only do these commands if you use sudo or sign in as root)

1. useradd username -> create a user
2. userdel username -> delete a user
3. usermod -G groupname username -> modify a user
4. groupadd groupname -> create a group
5. groupdel groupname -> delete a group

## Important System Files

- /etc/passwd - Stores basic user account information.
- /etc/shadow - Stores encrypted passwords.
- /etc/group - Stores group information.

Note: All of these commands require root access or sudo privileges. 

Reflection: 

I practiced sed commands with & without -i to understand the difference between testing and making real changes. I now understand how to manipulate text files and manage users on a basic level, which are key Linux administration skills.
