# Linux Notes: vi editor, vi vs. vim editor

## Key Differences:
- vi: Minimal, always available on Linux.
- VIM: VI Improved, with more features

## Commands Practiced:
- Insert mode:(When you want to insert text) "i"
- Save & quit/Save & quit w/o saving: ":wq!", ":q!"
- New Line: "o" (When you want to create a new line below your text), "O" (When you want to create a new line above your text)
- Delete:(When you want to delete a line of text) "dd" or "x" (When you want to delete 
- Copy/Paste: "yy", "p"
- Search:(When you want to search a word/letter) "/", example: "/Pattern"
- Navigation:(You can use your arrow keys) "h", "j", "k", "l"
- Undo:(accidentally deleted a line of text or word) "u"

## Observations
- I noticed no differences between using the vi and vim editors in this session. A simple Google search brought up more advanced feature sets of the Vim editor apart from vi.
- Learned a ton of commands when working in both editors, how to move efficiently, search, and edit cleanly.
