## Day 1: SELinux Basics Lab/Linux Notes I learned today

**What I Covered** 
- Compared files using "diff" and "cmp"
- Used "tar", "gzip", "gunzip" to compress/uncompress files
- Practiced truncating and splitting files "truncate"
- Executed multiple commands with ";" 

**SELinux Basics Lab/Hands-on takeaway:**
- Learned SELinux modes: Enforcing, Permissive, Disabled
- Investigated SELinux "denied" logs using "ausearch", "audit.log", "getenforce", & "setenforce 0 or 1"
- SELinux was in "Enforcing" mode
- Verified auditd was running.
- Used "ausearch -m avc -ts recent" and "sudo grep denied /var/log/audit/audit.log"
- Understood AVC Denial messages and why certain actions are blocked.
