# Windows Server 2022 - Lessons 1 & 2

## What I Learned

### Windows Server 2022 Editions

- **Essentials**  
  - For small businesses (≤ 25 users & 50 devices)  
  - Limited functionality, simple deployment  
  - No virtualization rights

- **Standard**  
  - For physical or lightly virtualized environments  
  - Includes **2 virtual machine licenses**

- **Datacenter**  
  - For **highly virtualized environments** (e.g., data centers)  
  - Includes **unlimited VM licenses**

- **Azure Edition**  
  - Used when running Windows Server 2022 as a **virtual machine in Azure**  
  - Supports unique Azure-only features

---

### Hyper-V Overview

- **Hyper-V** is a **native hypervisor** for creating and managing virtual machines.
- The **2019 Hyper-V Server** was the last standalone version with:
  - No GUI
  - No roles or features besides VM hosting

---

###  Azure-Specific Features (Only in Azure Edition)

- **Azure Automanage - Hotpatch**  
  → Installs OS updates **without requiring reboots** on Azure VMs

- **SMB over QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections)**  
  → Encrypts file shares using UDP instead of traditional TCP  
  → More secure and firewall-friendly for remote access

- **Extended Network for Azure**  
  → Allows on-prem VMs to **retain private IP addresses** when migrated to Azure  
  → Enables seamless hybrid cloud networking

###  Minimum Hardware Requirements

| Component       | Requirement                       |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| CPU             | 64-bit, 1.4 GHz                   |
| RAM             | 512MB minimum (2GB for GUI)       |
| Storage         | 32GB minimum                      |
| Network         | 1 Gbps throughput NIC             |

---

###  Deployment Options

- **Clean Install**: Fresh install on new system
- **In-Place Upgrade**: Retain data/configs while upgrading existing OS

---

###  Additional Concepts

- **Servicing Channels**: Determines how long updates/support last (LTSC = Long-Term Servicing Channel)
- **Licensing/Activation**: Tied to edition and virtualization rights

---

##  Questions I Had

- How often is **Hotpatching** used in enterprise Azure environments?
- Are there limitations to **Extended Network** when scaling a hybrid infrastructure?
- What is the **real-world impact** of using Core vs Desktop Experience in day-to-day admin work?

---

##  How Things Connected

- The editions and hardware requirements help determine **deployment planning**
- Azure-specific features like **Hotpatching** & **Extended Networking** directly tie into **hybrid identity** work in **Azure IAM**
- Core vs Desktop Experience teaches you how to balance **security and management style**

---

##  What I Need to Try Next

- Set up **two Windows Server 2022 VMs** — one with Core, one with Desktop Experience
- Compare GUI vs PowerShell management
- Test Hyper-V role installation on local machine or lab VM

---

##  Real-World Application / Use Case

- Understanding editions and deployment options is critical when:
  - Creating Active Directory environments
  - Building hybrid cloud (Azure + on-prem) networks
  - Working as an IAM engineer where **VM provisioning**, **policy enforcement**, and **server architecture** all
